## Abstract
Mapper programm was designed for photometric investigations of spotted late-type stars. Mapper has the following capabilities.

1. Modelling of light-curves of spotted stars.

2. Mapping the stellar surface by the set of circular temperature-uniform spots.

3. Light curves inversion using Tikhonov regularization technique.
